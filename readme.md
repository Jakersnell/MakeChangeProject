# MakeChangeProject

## Project Description
I recently embarked on a project to emulate a simplified cash register system. In this system, the user inputs the total price of their items and the amount they will be paying with. The program then calculates the change due, breaking it down from the highest denomination bills to the smallest coins. This project was an assignment from the Skill Distillery bootcamp, where I'm currently honing my skills.

## Reflection
What I particularly enjoyed about this project was its real-world applicability. Initially, I had reservations about Java's OOP-centric design, but as I delved deeper, I've come to appreciate its elegance. The more I work with Java, the more I understand and value the rationale behind its design philosophy. This project was not just a technical endeavor but also an enriching learning experience. I'm eager to continue my Java journey and explore more of what it has to offer in the future.
