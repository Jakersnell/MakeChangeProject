# MakeChangeProject



## Project Description
I recently embarked on a project to emulate a simplified cash register system. In this system, the user inputs the total price of their items and the amount they will be paying with. The program then calculates the change due, breaking it down from the highest denomination bills to the smallest coins. This project was an assignment from the Skill Distillery bootcamp, where I'm currently honing my skills.

## Technical Insights
The project was crafted using **Java 8** and I utilized the **Eclipse** editor as my IDE. One interesting aspect I delved into was the use of static variables in Java. By declaring a static variable inside my main class, it served as a sort of "global" variable - a concept reminiscent of static variables in C++. However, there are stark differences between the two languages:
- While Java has a strong emphasis on OOP, it can also facilitate procedural programming.
- Another distinction lies in memory management: 
  - In Java, the JVM allocates memory for static variables during runtime initialization.
  - In C++, memory for static variables is reserved at the program's onset, within its memory space.

## Reflection
What I particularly enjoyed about this project was its real-world applicability. Initially, I had reservations about Java's OOP-centric design, but as I delved deeper, I've come to appreciate its elegance. The more I work with Java, the more I understand and value the rationale behind its design philosophy. This project was not just a technical endeavor but also an enriching learning experience. I'm eager to continue my Java journey and explore more of what it has to offer in the future.

### Key Take-Aways / TLDR
  * Static variable's should be used sparingly, but are very useful in some case's.
  * Java Arrays and for-loops are very similar to other languages I've used.
  * Java's strictly OOP based model is handled very well, and is very elegant.
  * Java has a lot of powerful tools.
