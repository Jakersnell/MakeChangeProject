# MakeChangeProject

This project aims to emulate a much simplified cash register system. The user inputs the total price of their items, and the amount of money they will be using to pay for those items.  The program then provides the amount of change due, from highest sized bills usable, to smallest bills or coins. The project was programmed in Java 8, and I used the eclipse editor as my IDE. The project is an assignment from the bootcamp Skill Distillery, that I am currently enrolled in. This project was really cool. I have a lot to learn in Java and this project provided me the perfect opportunity to familiarize myself with various new tools. One discovery I made was the ability to create a kind of "global" variable by declaring a static variable inside of my main class. This reminds me of the use of static variables in C++. Of course, there are noticeable differences, given that Java is a strictly OOP language and the distinctions in memory management between the two languages. In Java, the JVM allocates memory for static variables during runtime initialization. In contrast, in C++, the memory for static variables is allocated at the start of the program's execution and is embedded within the program's memory space. I also really enjoyed that this is project is very analogous to the real-world. I have enjoyed learning Java a lot, and I am excited to continue this learning into the future.
